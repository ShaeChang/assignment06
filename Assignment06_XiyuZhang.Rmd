# Exercise 01
```{r Exercise 01}
#To calculate MSE, RMSE, MAE by hand and display the work
knitr::include_graphics("Exercise01.png")
```

As it shows, MSE = 4.4, RMSE = 2.10 (approximately), MAE = 1.6.
RMSE, whose value is larger than MAE, intensified the effect of outliers by taking the square of each difference, while MAE only calculate each absolute value equally. 


# Exercise 02
```{r Exercise 02}
#Using the above data, calculate the following “by hand” and show your work.
knitr::include_graphics("confusionmatrix.png")
knitr::include_graphics("accuracyprecisionrecall.png")
#and the value of accuracy, precision and recall/sensitivity is shown as below.
```

# Exercise 03
```{r Exercise 03}
#using the data, calculate the following “by hand” and show your work
knitr::include_graphics("exercise03.png")
#the value of accuracy, misclassification rate is shown as below.
```
